# Pok√©mon Battle Simulator

Welcome to the Pok√©mon Battle Simulator! This project allows you to simulate Pok√©mon battles 
using data from the [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/). You can choose your Pok√©mon, battle against 
random opponents, and experience dynamic battle features including weather effects, status effects, 
critical hits, healing moves, and evolution.

## Features

- **Choose Your Pok√©mon**: Select your favorite Pok√©mon to battle with.
- **Random Opponents**: Battle against randomly selected Pok√©mon.
- **Dynamic Battle Mechanics**: Experience battles with weather effects, critical hits, and more.
- **Evolution**: Watch your Pok√©mon evolve after gaining enough experience.
- **Detailed Battle Log**: Follow the battle with a detailed log of each move and event.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

You can install the `requests` library using pip:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ericmaddox/pokemon-battle
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd pokemon-battle
```

3. Run the script:
```bash
python pokemon_battle.py
```

4. Enter the name of the Pok√©mon you want to use and enjoy the battle!

## Usage

When you run the script, you'll be prompted to enter the name of your Pok√©mon. The script will 
then randomly select an opponent and simulate a battle. The battle log will be displayed in the 
terminal, showing each move and the resulting damage.

## Future Enhancements Roadmap

- **Trainer Customization**: Customize your trainer's name and appearance.
- **Battle Arenas**: Add different battle arenas with unique effects.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Implement local or online multiplayer battles.
- **AI Opponents**: Create AI opponents with varying difficulty levels.
- **Item Usage**: Allow trainers to use items during battles.
- **Special Moves**: Introduce special moves like Z-Moves or Mega Evolutions.
- **Battle Animations**: Add animations for moves and status effects.
