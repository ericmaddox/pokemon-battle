Welcome to the Pokémon Battle Simulator! This project allows you to simulate Pokémon battles using data from the PokéAPI. You can choose your Pokémon, battle against random opponents, and experience dynamic battle features including weather effects, status effects, critical hits, healing moves, and evolution.

## Features

- Choose Your Pokémon: Select your favorite Pokémon to battle with.
- Random Opponents: Battle against randomly selected Pokémon.
- Dynamic Battle Mechanics: Experience battles with weather effects, critical hits, and more.
- Evolution: Watch your Pokémon evolve after gaining enough experience.
- Detailed Battle Log: Follow the battle with a detailed log of each move and event.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- requests library

You can install the requests library using pip:
```sh
pip install requests
```

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ericmaddox/pokemon-battle.git
